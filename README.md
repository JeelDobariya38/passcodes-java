PassCodes is a basic password manager application designed for local storage of your passwords.
Your passwords are stored on your local machine rather than a third-party server, 
ensuring that your passwords remain secure as long as your laptop is in safe hands.

**Official Project Requirements:** Java 21+, Maven 3.9.8+  
**Official Target Base:** Users with basic knowledge of programming  
**Official Target Platform:** Windows 10+

Our official specifications are a bit high, 
but you can still run the app with some adjustments on many platforms using older versions of Java 
and even with zero knowledge of programming.

## Inspiration (Special Thanks)

This project is inspired by the concept of [Smart Manager](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38/Smart-Manager),
which failed to deliver a well-designed password managing app due to poor design decisions. 
PassCodes aims to create a better password manager while avoiding the mistakes made in the Smart Manager project.
